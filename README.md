# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
Identify bias for reviews in the Vine program.

Analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

- Percentage of the non-vine reviews were 28043 is what % of 28453 = 98.56%

## Summary: 

Data indicates that there are only 1.4% 5 star paid reviews and remaining 98% are unpaid reviews. 
Comparison between five star and less than five-star reviews show consistent trend.
Therefore, it can be concluded that reviews by vines are not biased.  

I have confirmed the similar analysis for the data where reviews were less than 5.

It proves that trend is consistent whether reviewers are paid or Unpaid.
